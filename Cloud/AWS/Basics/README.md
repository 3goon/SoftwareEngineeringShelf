# AWS Basics

## Definations
- **Regions** :  Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers. 
- **Availability Zones** : Inside every Region is a cluster of Availability Zones (AZ). An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. 
- **Interaction with AWS** : 
  - **AWS Management Console**: the web-based console
  - **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)**: API calls to AWS can also be performed by executing code with programming languages. 
  - **The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**:  unified tool to manage AWS services.

## Nice to remember
- __Regions__ should be choosen based on : __Latency__, __Price__, __Service availability__, __Data compliance__
- __AWS SDKs__ are available from C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
