# AWS Compute - Serverless

## Definations
- **AWS Fargate** : AWS Fargate is a purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers. 
- **AWS Lambda** : Is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  It has three primary components :
  - The Trigger
  - Code
  - Configuration
- **AWS Lambda function handler** : Is the method in your function code that processes events.
- 

## Nice to remember
- `Serverless` is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.
- `AWS Lambda` suports Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Java, .NET Core, or you can implement your Lambda functions to run on a __custom runtime__.
- `AWS Lambda` charges you for number of times your code is triggered.
- `AWS Lambda` is very cost effective on fast processing handlers.
