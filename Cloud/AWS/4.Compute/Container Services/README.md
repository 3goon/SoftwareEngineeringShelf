# AWS Compute - Container Services

## Definations
- **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** : End-to-end container orchestration service that allows you to quickly spin up new containers and manage them across a cluster of EC2 instances.
- **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** : A managed service and certified Kubernetes conformant to run Kubernetes on AWS and on-premises.
- **AWS Fargate** : A serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers.

## Nice to remember
- A `container` is a standardized unit that packages up your code and all of its dependencies.
- Read [Docker](#)(will add soon) document.
