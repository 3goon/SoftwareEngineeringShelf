# :cloud: **Software Engineering Shelf**

## **About**
This repository is for software engineers who want to have a good cheat sheet on the main software topics.
There are many topics out there to navigate and learn, but we create a [learning path](https://github.com/3goon/SoftwareEngineeringShelf/tree/main/Paths) for main ones. 

Each topic has categorized in a specific folder. inside each folder, there is a readme file which is the content of the sheet we designed.
